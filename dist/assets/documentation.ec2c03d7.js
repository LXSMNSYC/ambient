This method of generating colors generates a relatively good palette for general shades, but the hue and saturation of shades generated from the primary color is perceived lower. The biggest issue with simply brightening and darkening color is that <strong>the relative difference luminance of color shades</strong> are much smaller for brighter colors. For example, a shade step for a yellow color is perceived to be a lesser change compared to a darker color like blue. </p>"),l=e("<h4>Relative Luminance Generation Algorithm</h4>"),c=e("<p>A New method of generating shades were devised by gaining the relative luminance (WCAG RGB Luminance) of shades and affecting the relative luminance for each shades generated. The algorithm gets the relative luminance of the current primary color and adjusts each shades' luminance by a percentage point given by the change array. The algorithm also decreases saturation for lighter colors and increases the saturation for darker colors maintaining relative saturation levels. Hues are also adjusted per color shade. The biggest issue with utilizing luminance as the only method of generating shades is that darker shades fail contrast tests as relative luminance steps decrease in intensity in efforts of maintaining hue and saturation. </p>"),d=e("<h4>Lab Color mix</h4>"),h=e("<p>The two methods are blended together at a ratio of 50:50 from the legacy generation method (for general shades) and the relative luminance method to generate a average of the two methods using Lab color (to maintain saturation and hue adjustments).</p>"),m=e("<h4>Shade Correction</h4>"),u=e("<p>Now that all of the color shades are generated, a simple shade correction is done through mixing a black or white solid color depending on the contrast of the color to generate UI usable color shade (ie.
